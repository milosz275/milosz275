` C/C++, Networks, Linux `

- I'm computer science student eager to learn everything that comes in my taking off IT career. Things I'm passionate about make me try my hardest to deepen my understanding in a given subject.
- Every coding project has to meet software engineering standards, follow design patterns and be well made from the ground up. I'm familiar with object oriented programming as well as advanced programming techniques, STL library and I'm studying Qt at this moment.
- Networks is something that keeps me going. I've created some simple socket apps making research on my own. I'm well up on used technologies and into basic cryptography systems like RSA.
- On the daily basis I'm a combo Windows/Linux user trying to optimise my time best possible way. Let's take a look at some code:)

## My projects:
### [Winsock Qt Messenger](https://github.com/mldxo/Simple-Qt-and-Winsock-Messenger#readme)
It lets the server and the client connect and message each other. It works in local networks as well as in the Internet, if you have your port forwarding set. Client can connect through domain name. Communicator uses Windows' username for nickname.

### [RSA Key generator + text encryption](https://github.com/mldxo/rsa-keygen#readme)
Fully functional tool generating RSA key pair. It supports big numbers and text encryption.

### [International draughts SFML game](https://github.com/mldxo/checkers-gui#readme)
Checkers GUI game. Currently in early stage of completion, but functional in player vs player contest.

### [Debian/Linux Teamspeak Autorun Service](https://github.com/mldxo/Teamspeak-Service#readme)
Simple but robust service allowing to run Teamspeak server as soon as you boot your Linux server.
